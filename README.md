### Facebook Vs Adword : Campaign Performance Analysis

This is a business project that collected the ad-campaign dataset over a year for 365 days and analyzed the performance of Facebook Ads Vs Adword Ads.
When you open the Capstone Dataset spreadsheet, you will notice that it is a collection of data comparing the performance of two separate ad campaigns: 

- a Facebook Ad campaign (in the blue colored columns of the sheet) and 

- an AdWords Ad campaign (in the green colored columns) 

The data is collected for every day of the year 2023, so you have 365 lines of campaign data to analyze! 
Ultimately, we want to determine whether one of these ad campaigns is more effective in terms of conversions compared to the other. But before we address that question, we should better understand the conversion data for each of the campaigns.
To better understand how effective our campaigns are at producing conversions, we will begin by analyzing the relationship between a campaign’s number of clicks and the corresponding number of conversions.

Let’s do this by calculating: 

## Descriptive Statistics

Here we will calculate the following:
1. The measures of central tendency<br>
   Calculate the mean, median, and mode for Facebook Ad Clicks and Facebook Ad Conversions.
   Calculate the mean, median, and mode for AdWords Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Conversions.  

2. Some measures of spread<br>
   Calculate the standard deviations for Facebook Ad Clicks and Facebook Ad Conversions data.
   Calculate the standard deviations for the AdWords Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Conversions data.
   
3. The frequency and correlation data for a campaign’s clicks and conversions<br>
   Create a frequency table for Facebook Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Clicks data with the groupings which are as follows:<br>
   - We’ll address this question by, first, creating a frequency table that tells us exactly how many days of the year we recorded specific numbers of conversions:
     - less than 6 conversions,
     - 6 - 10 conversions,
     - 11 - 15 conversions,
     - And greater than 15 conversions

    Create a scatter plot and calculate the correlation coefficient for Facebook Ad Clicks and Facebook Ad Conversions data.<br>
    Create a scatter plot and calculate the correlation coefficient for the AdWords Ad Clicks and AdWords Ad Conversions data.<br>
